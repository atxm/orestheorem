#### Sections
##### Introduction
<a href="https://github.com/atxm" title="Adam's GitHub profile" style="color: orange; text-decoration: none;">Adam</a> presents three questions from which a fellow student may choose one to answer for credit for the assignment. The three questions are as follows:
- What are the two criteria a graph must meet in order to satisfy Ore’s theorem and therefore be a Hamiltonian graph?
- If a graph $\textcolor{teal}{G}$ does not meet both criteria to satisfy Ore’s theorem, is $\textcolor{teal}{G}$ Hamiltonian?
- What is one example of a real-world application of Hamiltonian cycles, and how does this tie in with Ore’s theorem?

He then brings up the background knowledge required to understand Ore's theorem—mainly basic graph theory and traversal concepts, providing an example of a Hamiltonian graph.

<a href="https://github.com/YoussefKoreatam" title="Koreatam's GitHub profile" style="color: orange; text-decoration: none;">Koreatam</a> concludes the introductory section by explaining the primary concept of the presentation and providing a formal definition of Ore's theorem, defining it for the remainder of the presentation as $\textcolor{gold}{\Omega}$ and separating it into its two criteria $\textcolor{gold}{\Omega_1}$ and $\textcolor{gold}{\Omega_2}$ (pronounced *Omega-one* and *Omega-two*).

##### Examples
<a href="https://github.com/tkang034" title="Kang's GitHub profile" style="color: orange; text-decoration: none;">Kang</a> provides a series of three examples that consider the three possible outcomes of examining a graph $\textcolor{teal}{G}$ while keeping Ore's theorem  in mind:

1. $\textcolor{teal}{G_1} \vdash \textcolor{gold}{\Omega}$ and $\exists$ a Hamiltonian cycle $\textcolor{orange}{T}$ in $\textcolor{teal}{G_1}$
2. $\textcolor{teal}{G_2} \text{ } \cancel\vdash \text{ } \textcolor{gold}{\Omega}$ and $\cancel{\exists}$ a Hamiltonian cycle in $\textcolor{teal}{G_2}$
3. $\textcolor{teal}{G_3} \text{ } \cancel{\vdash} \text{ } \textcolor{gold}{\Omega}$ and $\exists$ a Hamiltonian cycle $\textcolor{orange}{T}$ in $\textcolor{teal}{G_3}$

Case 3 emphasizes that a graph $\textcolor{teal}{G}$ may still be Hamiltonian despite not satisfying $\textcolor{gold}{\Omega}$, which is a very important consideration.

##### Applications
<a href="https://github.com/MarsCSmajor" title="Serrano's GitHub profile" style="color: orange; text-decoration: none;">Serrano</a> examines the applications of Hamiltonian graph theory, like router networking and navigation systems, highlighting the importance of Ore's theorem and related Hamiltonian results in maximizing efficiency.

##### Conclusion
<a href="https://github.com/windoge102" title="Wong's GitHub profile" style="color: orange; text-decoration: none;">Wong</a> preserves the brevity of the presentation by neatly summarizing its entirety in one slide, detailing the applications of Ore's theorem and the closely linked Hamiltonian graph theory once more.
